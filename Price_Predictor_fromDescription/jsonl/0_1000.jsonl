If your dryer thermal fuse is blown, your dryer will not start or may stop working mid-cycle.

Wp8318084 Lid Switch is compatible with Whirlpool, Admiral, Amana, Crosley, Estate, Inglis, Kenmore, KitchenAid, Magic Chef, Maytag, Roper. Lid Switch Wp8318084 is an essential component of the washing machine's safety system and is responsible for preventing the washer from operating while the lid is open. Green grounding wire included.\", '\ud83d\udd27 DIY eTips Included - Not sure how to replace the Pn ? Helpful information can be found on the page below. Scroll down to get more repair tips. Acquire valuable skills during the DIY repair project. Whirlpool  Lid Switch For Washer will help if your appliance does not start, does not agitate, the timer does not advance, or it pumps but does not spin. Installing the Whirlpool Lid Switch  in a washer is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps.', \"\ud83d\udca1 Whirlpool Lid Switch Wp8318084 is located under the lid of the washer and is activated when the lid is closed. When the lid is closed, the switch sends a signal to the washer's control board, allowing it to start the wash cycle. If the lid is open or the switch is malfunctioning, the control board will not receive the signal and the washer will not start. Washer Lid Switch  meets or exceeds all manufacturer specifications. We provide a lifetime warranty and guarantee 100% money back.\", '\ud83d\udca1 What is the difference between lid lock and lid switch? They are two different components used in washing machines to prevent the machine from operating while the lid is open. A lid switch detects when the lid is closed and sends a signal to the control board to start the wash cycle, while a lid lock physically locks the lid in place to prevent it from being opened during the wash cycle. Both components are important for ensuring the safe and proper operation of a washing machine.', '\ud83d\udca1 Is it possible to bypass the Lid Switch? While it may be technically possible to bypass the lid switch, doing so is not recommended as it could be dangerous and may cause damage to the appliance. By bypassing the lid switch, you could potentially expose yourself to electric shock or injury from moving parts. Additionally, if the appliance continues to run with the lid open, it could cause damage to the appliance itself or to your surroundings.']\n{\"Manufacturer\": \"PartsBroz\", \"Item Weight\": \"0.634 ounces\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"3.35 x 2.87 x 2.2 inches\", \"Size\": \"Single\", \"Color\": \"As pictured\", \"Style\": \"Lid Switch\", \"Item Package Quantity\": \"1\", \"Date First Available\": \"July 12, 2019\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Your humidifier helps by dispersing water vapor into the air to replace the lost moisture. Most humidifiers contain filters, which help to keep the moist air clear of any impurities. They remove particles from the water before it is dispensed into the air. You need to change your filters regularly, so you can continue to enjoy healthy air and keep your humidifier in good condition. The frequency of changing depends on the quality of your household water supply and how often you are using the humidifier. Check your user manual or the manufacturers website to make sure you know what type you need to buy.']\n['TWELVE PACK: Includes 12 High Quality Replacement EFP Humidifier Wick Filters for Duracraft Honeywell Kenmore AC-801, AC801, HAC-801, HAC801 and Duracraft DH840C DH7800 DA1005 Model Humidifiers.
